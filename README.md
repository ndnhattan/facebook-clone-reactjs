# Facebook Clone

![preview]()

This is the React project for the open-source Chat Platform. To see the back-end project, see the [Facebook Clone NestJS](https://github.com/ndnhattan/facebook-clone-nestjs).

# Installation

Before you try to run this project locally, you must have both the React & NestJS project, as well as a SQL database. I use MySQL, but you can switch to another database like PostgreSQL very easily.

1. Clone this repository and install all dependencies.
2. Go to [Facebook Clone NestJS](https://github.com/ndnhattan/facebook-clone-nestjs) and follow all the instructions on setting up the backend.
3. Run both projects using the `start:dev` script using either `npm`, `yarn`, or whatever package manager you use.
